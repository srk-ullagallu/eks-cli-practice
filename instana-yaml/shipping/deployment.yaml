# - describe the pod
# - checks the logs
# - cross check the secrets and cm mounted well
# - check the probes are successfully executed
# - some times probes also casuses the issues because initial delay seconds less no of seconds for health check start
# - when you're trying access service it give connection refused there is a problem i.e service not connected with pod
# - mismatch the deployment and service
# after deploying application as a pod in k8s first describe the pod wheather it is pod started or not any failures like probes or config or secrets are not mounted
# If everything is good pod running successfully then after checks logs for any failures of applications
